***Stack data structure***

# Algorithm to find smallest element in the stack in O(1) time!

>In this article, a new approach is discussed that supports minimum with O(1) extra space. We define a variable minEle that stores the current minimum element in the stack. <br>

```
void getMin()
    {
        if (s.empty())
            cout << "Stack is empty\n";
 
        // variable minEle stores the minimum element
        // in the stack.
        else
            cout <<"Minimum Element in the stack is: "
                 << minEle << "\n";
    }
